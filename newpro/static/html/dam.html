Sathanur Dam, a stunning engineering marvel, is located at a distance of 30 kilometres from the city of Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu.
This breathtaking structure has been built over River Thenpennai (River Pennaiyar) flowing through the Chennakesava Hills in Thandarampet Taluk.
The reservoir is called the Sathanur Reservoir and is considered as one of the major dams in the state.
The structure consists of pleasant parks, a fish grotto and a huge crocodile farm that attracts nature enthusiasts and tourists from all over the world.
The site is strikingly beautiful during the monsoons as the river gushes with clear waters.
It is so attractive that it has been a favourite spot for many feature films, especially in the 50s and 60s.
