Annamalaiyar Temple, a breathtaking temple complex dedicated to Lord Shiva, is located in the bustling town of Thiruvannamalai, at the base of Annamalai Hills in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
As you walk closer to the grand temple complex, you'll notice how marvellously the structures have been built.
This 25-acreÂ complex is sure to mesmerize you with its beauty and elegance.
There are numerous intricately adorned shrines and halls within the entire temple complex which is also considered as one of the largest temple complexes in India.
Do make it a point to see the splendid eastern gopuram (tower), which is one the tallest temple towers in India as it stands 66 metres tall and the gorgeous thousand-pillared hall that extends serenely in the temple complex.
