Thiruvannamalai district is an administrative district, one of the 38 districts in the 
state.Known as the "Troy of the East" by the British, Gingee Fort is located in Thiruvannamalai District of Tamil Nadu, 
160 kilometres from the state capital, Chennai and near the Union Territory of Puducherry. 
Locals have given the fort some notable names such as Senji, Chenji, Jinji or Senchi Fort.
 The majestic fort has three different hilltop citadels and a massive boundary of thick walls and cliffs.
  Owing to its enormous structure the fort is fortified to the extent that Shivaji, the Maratha king, named it as the "most impregnable fortress in India." 
  Visiting the fort makes one learn the reason for why it has been called by such influential names.
  As you reach the fort, you realise that it has been located at the most strategic location which made it difficult for the enemies to enter its premise.
  The fort indeed is a result of genius minds.
